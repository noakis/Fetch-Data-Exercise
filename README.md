# Fetch-Data-Exercise
Fetch and Render Data from External Source

DESCRIPTION:

In this exercise specific data is fetched and rendered from Hacker News, using React and displayed as needed.

HOW TO RUN:

Clone the repository into your local environment.

ROADMAP FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

Different styling options with Bootstrap will make this look better design-wise. I will continue to use this model to make other projects such as this where specific data can be fetched to render on own site.
